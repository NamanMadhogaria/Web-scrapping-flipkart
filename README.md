# Web-scrapping-flipkart
This project is a Python-based web scraper built to extract sports shoe data from Flipkart. It focuses on collecting two main sets of product listings: the first 120 sports shoes available (regardless of brand), and running shoes specifically from four well-known brands—Puma, Reebok, Campus, and Nike. The scraper gathers essential product information including brand name, product title, and price, while also attempting to capture optional details such as discounts, ratings, and product URLs, if available. This data is then stored in two clean CSV files: all_sports_shoes.csv for the general list of 120 products, and running_shoes_by_brand.csv for the filtered brand-specific running shoes. All output is saved in the output/ directory for easy access and analysis.

The scraper is written in Python and uses the requests, beautifulsoup4, and pandas libraries for making HTTP requests, parsing HTML content, and handling data, respectively. All dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file, and can be installed using pip install -r requirements.txt. After setting up your environment, simply run the script flipkart_scraper.py using the command python flipkart_scraper.py. The script scrapes approximately the first three pages of Flipkart’s sports shoes search results to collect around 120 items, and uses keyword filtering to extract running shoes under the selected brand names.This project is a Python-based web scraper built to extract sports shoe data from Flipkart.
